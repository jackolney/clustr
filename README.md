### clustr

A place to store scripts for automating [CascadeDashboard](https://github.com/jackolney/CascadeDashboard) using the MRC cluster.

Relies heavily on [Rich's](https://github.com/richfitz) [didewin](https://github.com/dide-tools/didewin) tools!

This is really for internal use and will not be that useful to anyone else.
